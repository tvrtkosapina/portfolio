# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the personal portfolio of Tvrtko Šapina.

This repository contains selected projects demonstrating my work.

### Contents

The repository includes the following projects:

- **Euler’s Method for ODEs (Python, GUI)**  
  Implementation of Euler’s method for solving ordinary differential equations, including a graphical user interface (Tkinter) and plotting functionality.  
  A detailed explanation of the implementation and numerical background is provided in the accompanying presentation:  
  `Rješavanje diferencijalnih jednadžbi Eulerovom metodom.pptx`  , while the code is in a file: `Rješavanje diferencijalnih jednadžbi Eulerovom metodom.py`
  *Language: Croatian*

- **Banknote Authentication – Clustering Analysis (Python, Jupyter Notebook)**  
  Exploratory analysis and clustering-based approach applied to the  
  [Banknote Authentication dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication).  
  Files included:
  - `Banknote_auth_final version.ipynb`
  - `data_banknote_authentication.csv`  
  *Language: English*

### Used technologies and skills

- *Python for data analysis* (NumPy, pandas, Sklearn)
- *OOP in Python*
- *GUI in Python* (TkInter)
